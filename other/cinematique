D:P:20:Finally ! Back up ! ... How is that, you're not here for us ? Didn't you receive our SOS ?
D:P:20:WHAT !? The capital has been devastated !? That's why we didn't have back up...
D:P:20:What happened here ?

P:20:y:1
D:P:20:You see that monster. It has been a few days that they attack us from the West except yesterday when they came from the Est
D:P:20:But wait, is it what you were chasing ?
D:P:20:This means that they were more than one group !! This means that if we didn't stop them here, nobody knows what they would have done !
D:P:20:I am afraid we don't have much time and they are too many...
D:P:20:Their camp is West in the woods of Disoom ! You need to scout there to know what we will have to face but don't fight, ok ?
D:P:20:However, there is something strange, if they were so many, why didn't they flood us with all their army ?
D:P:20:They are hiding something
